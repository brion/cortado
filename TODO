TODO for cortado

- make synchronization work for online streams
- make synchronization work for seekable streams
- dynamically choose the audio sink to use (currently hardcoded)

- implement Query duration/position, not sure how to do that since
  we only have the byte position. possibly put duration as a param or
  maybe do a single seek for the last page to get the last granule position.
  We need position/duration in time to implement current position in the
  GUI since using the byte position would result in values way past the
  actual playback position because of buffering.

- implement a network buffer, use BUFFERING messages to pause/play the
  pipeline.

- clean up some issues with pause/play stuttering.

- do some testing on live streams with JST backend.

- JST backend does not use newsegment events. 

- disable sound option

- possibly use java2 image functions?

- network speed?

- pop up an error dialog for java.security.AccessControlException when
  doing at java.net.URLConnection.getContentType(Unknown Source)
	at com.fluendo.player.Cortado.start(Cortado.java:432)
	at sun.applet.AppletPanel.run(Unknown Source)
  to tell the user his stream and his applet need to be on the same server
