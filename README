WHAT IT IS
----------

This is the first public release of the source code for Fluendo's
"Cortado" Java media player.  The player can be used as an applet to play
back files and network streams.  It was created to integrate with
the Flumotion Streaming Server.

This first release has support for
- local files and network streams
- Ogg and Multipart containers
- Theora, JPEG and Smoke video codecs
- Vorbis and MuLaw audio codecs
- 1.1 javasound API
- 1.4 javax sound API
- basic HTTP authentication
- buffering

The build setup is still a little bit shaky, combining ant build stuff
with a standard Makefile.  We could use a little help there.
