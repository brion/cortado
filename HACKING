NOTES
-----
- the plan is to:
  - build com.fluendo.utils in a jar
  - build com.jcraft in a jar
  - build com.fluendo.jheora in a jar (relying on jcraft and utils jars)
  - build com.fluendo.jst in a jar (relying on utils)
  - build com.fluendo.plugin into a jar (all combined, relying on all above)

- FIXME: what to do with the examples ?
